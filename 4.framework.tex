\section{Conceptual Framework}

Based on these preliminary results, we discovered four criteria to conceptualize recommendations for software developers. These concepts are presented below with examples derived from our studies and other software engineering research.

\subsection{Demonstrate Desire}

In the \peer~study, we found that participants expressing  eagerness  to  use  a  recommended  tool led to more effective recommendations.  For example, during one study session a participant suggested using multi-level sorting functionality in Excel. Their partner, L11, demonstrated a desire to use the tool by  responding ``Oh!  Add  level!  Yes, awesome!" and adopted multi-level sorting for the remainder of the study tasks. This suggests recommending desirable tools and actions can increase adoption among developers. Meanwhile, in another case a participant asked their partner if they wanted to use the R statistical computing software\footnote{\url{https://www.r-project.org/}} to complete a task, but their partner responds ``No, no, no..." (S14). This shows how a lack of desire to use a specific tool can negatively impact the outcome of a recommendation. 

Software engineering research also suggests desire impacts the activities and behavior of developers. For example, Senyard and colleagues suggest that the desire of developers is important for motivating programmers to contribute to free and open source software and maintain successful projects~\cite{senyard2004have}. Furthermore, Murphy-Hill and colleagues found that one barrier to peer interactions is \textit{developer inertia}. This refers to when programmers do \textit{not} desire to share or learn about new software engineering tools because they ``feel that they do not need to discover a new tool because existing tools will do the job"~\cite[p.~16]{Murphy-Hill2015HowDoUsers}. These are examples of how the desire of software engineers can impact their behavior and decision-making when completing programming tasks.

\subsection{Familiarity}

Another key takeaway from the \peer~study is that users are more likely to adopt recommendations for tools and concepts they are familiar with it. In this study, we defined this criteria as users explicitly expressing familiarity with the environment surrounding a recommended tool. An example of an familiarity impacting the outcome of a recommendation in our experiment arose when L8 asked about using the \texttt{COUNTIF} function in Excel. L7 was familiar with the function and used the tool replying ``Yeah...here we go". However, we also found unfamiliarity negatively influenced adoption when a participant recommended using R to create a plot for analyzing the data, but their partner responded ``I donâ€™t know R" (S9). In this case, the participant's unfamiliarity with R led to an ineffective recommendation. 

Prior work also suggests familiarity can impact effectiveness. Goodman and colleagues found that the more knowledge employees have about the workplace and environment, or \textit{work familiarity}, improves performance~\cite{goodman1992familiarity}. Similarly, Espinosa and colleagues found that familiarity impacts the completion of software engineering tasks for distributed development teams~\cite{espinosa2002shared}. Finally, Ko and colleagues suggest that the majority of developers' time is spent becoming familiar with unfamiliar code and found that code comprehension impacts other development activities such as navigation, searching, and tool usage~\cite{ko2006exploratory}. This indicates that familiarity plays a role in developer behavior and impacts their adoption of useful practices.

% Murphy-Hill and colleagues propose integrating familiarity into recommender systems by ranking commands based on similarity of those used by colleagues with collaborative filtering~\cite{Murphy-Hill2012Fluency}.

\subsection{Social Context}

In the results from the \sorry~study, we found that one major issue with our \tele design is its lack of social context. Social context refers to the standard practices and activities necessary to participate in software engineering by interacting with developers and contributing to projects, specifically in open source software. In the \sorry~evaluation, many developers complained that \tool did not adhere to formatting guidelines when automatically adding the \EP plugin to project \textit{pom.xml} files. The most common social context complaint we received from GitHub users was that \tool messed up the whitespace of their project's maven \pom files when adding the \EP plugin (See Figure~\ref{fig:botse}b). One developer replied ``The automated tool you use messed up the pom.xml formatting to an extent that I could not see it" (P5). This suggests our bot's inability to adjust to the social context surrounding software development negatively impacted developers' likelihood to adopt recommendations.

Prior work also shows that social context is important in making recommendations to software engineers. For instance, Cerezo and colleagues note that communicating with chatbots is difficult because most systems implement single purpose and bot-driven communication techniques. To improve recommendations from bots, they propose using \textit{user-driven conversations} to follow the flow of human discourse~\cite{cerezo2019building}. Additionally, Wessel and colleagues studied the usage of bots in open source software and found that contributors face challenges interacting with bots due to their limited decision-making and poor feedback, and their most desired improvements included making bots smarter and improving interactions with developers~\cite{wessel2018power}. Thus, effectively integrating recommendations with the social context of software engineering can impact developer adoption and perception of tools.

\subsection{Developer Workflow}

Another key result from \sorry was that the \tele in \tool disrupted the workflow of developers. The most notable example of this was the fact that our automated pull requests for \EP often broke builds for repositories. Many projects have adopted continuous integration systems, such as TravisCI,\footnote{\url{https://travis-ci.org/}} to automatically build and integrate changes into projects. However, modifying projects to add a new static analysis tool often introduced many new errors and caused the build to fail. An example of this from our evaluation can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:error}. Out of the 52 pull requests made, at least 17 resulted in a broken build. Many developers complained about this in their feedback on \tool, including P18 who commented ``This PR failed automatic checks, I think it should be closed". This interruption of developer workflow often discouraged users from merging pull requests from our system and accepting the recommendation.

Other work in software engineering also notes the importance of integration into the workflow of developers. For example, Sadowski found that one of the primary reasons developers at Google ignore static analysis tool warnings is because they are not integrated into their workflow~\cite{sadowski2018lessons} and implemented Tricorder to run numerous program analysis tools on code during code reviews~\cite{Tricorder}. Furthermore, Distefano and colleagues report that presenting static analysis tool output to developers at Facebook outside of their workflow, i.e. assigning bug lists from overnight builds, resulted in a nearly 0\% fix rate for these defects. However, configuring development tools to run on patches submitted to the code base during code reviews, or ``diff-time", increased the fix rate of reported bugs to approximately 70\%~\cite{Distefano2019Facebook}. These studies provide examples of how integration into developer workflow can impact the effectiveness of recommendations and developer behavior.

% %This section presents approaches for making recommendations to developers. These designs are derived from prior work in peer interactions and concepts from nudge theory, and differ on the locality and actionability of the suggestions. Our conceptual framework introduces novel digital nudges types for making recommendations to software engineers: \telemarketer; \location; and \timing. Each of these constituted nudge types are defined and motivated below. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the conceptual framework in increasing software engineering action adoption among developers by building tools and examining existing systems that implement these digital nudge types.d

% %\subsection{\location}

% To examine the effectiveness of spatial locality for digital nudges, we came up with \textit{situated nudges}. Situated nudges make suggestions to software developers at the location where a useful software engineering action is applicable.

% High spatial locality

% %\subsection{\timing}

% Location (hot and cold) [nudge theory] finds that timely feedback can improve acceptance of suggestion. Examples of these in real life? For example, handing out floss, right before entering a bathroom after eating ribs, increased chances of adopting flossing by 20\% (\todo{replace with example not completely made up}).

% To evaluate the timing of digital nudges, we introduce the concept of \emph{just-in-time nudges}. These nudges make recommendations to developers at a moment when a software engineering action is appropriate.

% We hypothesize that developers will prefer just-in-time nudges when a software engineering tool is most applicable over nudges presented at different times. Recommendations made when they are appropriate provide more convenience to users so developers don't have to figure out when's the best time to use a tool or practice. This can help improve adoption of software engineering actions for developers while they are completing programming tasks. A potential downside to just-in-time nudges is that they can interrupt developers in their work, which research suggests may lead to a loss of task context~\cite{parnin2010interrupted}.

\end{figure*}


% %\subsection{Public nudge}

% %Humans are more likely to adopt behavior if there is external pressure to do so.

% %We define \textit{public nudges} as nudges that are visible and available to see by a specific community. They may also involve social pressure if certain behaviors aren't adopted. For example, badges on GitHub are public nudges viewable to users who visit a repository and can influence their decision to contribute or use the product. These badges display whether projects adopt certain software engineering behaviors, such as passing builds. Figure \ref{fig:red_badge} presents a badge for a project that does not use a useful software engineering processes during development, while the developers for a project with a badge in Figure \ref{fig:green_badge} integrate software engineering actions in their development process. Trockman and colleagues examined the effect of these public nudges for npm\footnote{https://www.npmjs.com/} packages on GitHub and found that the addition of badges correlated with improvements in the quality of the project, i.e. adding a quality assurance badge displaying code coverage increased the coverage of tests~\cite{trockman2018badges}

% %Our hypothesis is that developers are more likely to adopt useful software engineering actions if they are publicly nudged to do so.

% % \subsection{Social nudge}

% % Nudge theory finds that people are more likely to adopt a useful behavior if others they know already do it. Perloff studied the impact of social media on body image and self-perception among American girls, and proposes using ``media-based interventions...to nudge individuals into changing their attitudes and behaviors"~\cite[p.~364]{perloff2014social}. This work suggests social media use is key in creating social comparisons and influencing users to adopt harmful behaviors such as body dissatisfaction and eating disorders.

% % To study digital nudges in a social context, we introduce \textit{social nudges}. These nudges suggest software engineering actions that have been adopted by a developer's friends or colleagues. An example of this is seen in prior work examining peer interactions. Murphy-Hill conducted interviews and surveys with software engineers and found that developers prefer recommendations from peers over other methods of tool discovery such as tutorials, discussion threads, tool encounters, and written descriptions~\cite{Murphy-Hill2015HowDoUsers}.

% % Our hypothesis is that developers are more likely to adopt behaviors recommended in a nudge if they know it is used by a friend or colleague.

% % \subsection{Apprehensive nudge}

% % If you can show a target behaviors usefulness by presenting multiple places it can be applied, people are more likely to adopt it.

% % We created the concept of \textit{apprehensive nudges}, which provide multiple locations where software engineering activities can be applied, to study how this impacts activity adoption for developers.

% % [benefits/trade-offs;hypothesis]

% % \subsection{Automated nudge}

% % If you do the work for them, humans are more likely to adopt specific behaviors. \todo{Example= automatic magazine subscription renewal due to status quo bias [Nudge, 35]}

% % To determine if automatically performing software engineering actions for developers impacts adoption for developers, we introduce \textit{automated nudges}. There are many ways automation is used to improve software engineering and help developers adopt helpful behaviors. For instance, Mirhosseini and colleagues investigated creating automated pull requests to convince developers to upgrade outdated dependencies using greenkeeper\footnote{https://greenkeeper.io} to manage dependency package versions for GitHub projects~\cite{sam2017autopullrequests}. They found that automated pull requests were useful in increasing awareness of out-of-date package dependencies to developers.

% % [benefits/trade-offs;hypothesis]

% % \subsection{Tutorial nudge}

% % If you show people how to do a certain behavior, then they are more likely to adopt it.

% % We define \textit{tutorial nudges} as digital nudges that show developers how to use a specific software engineering tool or programming activity. For example,...

% % [benefits/trade-offs;hypothesis]

% % \subsection{Reminder nudge}

% % If you continually remind humans to adopt a certain activity, they are more likely to adopt it.

% % To evaluate the effectiveness of reminders, we developed \textit{reminder nudges} to periodically recommend useful software engineering actions to programmers.

% % [Conceptual implementation]

% % [benefits/trade-offs;hypothesis]

% % \subsection{Positive nudge}

% % Nudge theory suggests using positive language is more effective in helping people adopt target behaviors. For example, Doberstein and colleagues evaluated using positive messages to improve attitudes about increasing residential housing density in Canada~\cite{doberstein2016positive}. They compared a neutral control statement of benefits with public statements, private statements, and expert comparisons.  \todo{Framing [Nudge, 36-37]}

% % To determine if developers respond better to positive or negative recommendations, we introduce \textit{positive nudges} that commend developers for their work rather than blaming them to encourage future software engineering action adoption.

% % If you recommend developer actions in a positive way, then developers are more likely to adopt them.

% % \subsection{Effects}

% % We hope our nudges have some of the following effects on developers who receive recommendations for software engineering actions...

% % \todo{Some interesting effects to consider:}
% % \begin{itemize}
% % \item Baader-Meinhof --- you start seeing something you just learned or on your mind everywhere.
% % \item Diderot Effect --- the act of getting one new thing triggers a cascade of other new things.
% % \item Novelty Effect --- using something new makes you think you are more productivity
% % \item ... should look at behavioral and marketing psychology stuff...
% % \end{itemize}

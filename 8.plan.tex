\section{Research Plan}

This section presents the research plan for the completion of my dissertation. All studies are referred to by their short names presented above.

\subsection{Completed Projects}

I have completed and published the following projects for this research proposal:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \peer: VL/HCC 2017~\cite{VLHCC}
    \item[] \sorry: BotSE workshop at ICSE 2019~\cite{BotSE}
\end{itemize}

Most of the research outlined in this proposal was presented and published for the 2019 ICSE Doctoral Symposium~\cite{Symposium}. Additionally, several of the projects for this work have been presented at various industry conferences such as Red Hat QECampX Raleigh 2018\footnote{https://qecamp.com/info} and DevConf 2019\footnote{https://devconf.info/us/2019}.

\subsection{Submitted Projects}

The following projects are completed and currently under submission for publication:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \sugg: ICSE 2020*
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Upcoming Projects}

I plan to complete and submit the following projects for publication before my defense in Spring 2020:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{\proc}: FSE 2020*
    \item[] \nudge: FSE 2020*

\section{Research Plan}

This section presents the research plan for the completion of my dissertation. All studies are referred to by their short names presented above.

\subsection{Completed Projects}

The results for the \peer~study were published in VL/HCC 2017~\cite{VLHCC} and \tele was published at the BotSE workshop at ICSE 2019~\cite{BotSE}. Additionally,I published and presented the majority of this proposal for the Doctoral Symposium at ICSE 2019~\cite{Symposium}. Finally, research for this work has also been presented at various industry conferences such as QECampX 2018,\footnote{https://qecamp.com/info} Red Hat's local quality engineering conference, and DevConf 2019\footnote{https://devconf.info/us/2019}.

\subsection{Submitted Projects}

The results for the \sugg~study are currently under submission for ICSE 2020.

\subsection{Upcoming Projects}

I plan to submit the nudge-bot study to FSE 2020

\subsection{Proposed Timeline}
 Table~\ref{tab:timeline} presents a plan for the completion of the work proposed in this thesis document.

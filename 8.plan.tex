\section{Research Plan}

This section presents the research plan for the completion of my dissertation. All studies are referred to by their short names presented above.

\subsection{Completed Projects}

I have completed and published the following projects for this research proposal:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \peer: VL/HCC 2017~\cite{VLHCC}
    \item[] \sorry: BotSE 2019~\cite{BotSE}
\end{itemize}

The preliminary research outlined in this proposal was also presented and published for the Doctoral Symposium at ICSE 2019 in Montreal, Canada~\cite{Symposium}. Additionally, this work has been presented at various industry conferences including QECampX 2018~\cite{QECamp},\footnote{\url{https://www.qecamp.com/}, requires Red Hat employee login} a Red Hat quality engineering conference, and DevConf 2019~\cite{DevConf},\footnote{\url{https://devconf.info/us/2019}} an open source conference for software developers and technologists.

\subsection{Upcoming Projects}

The following projects are currently under submission or in progress for publication and plan to complete in Spring 2020:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \sugg: ICSE 2020*
    \item[] \nudge: \todo{?}*
    \item[] \diss: PhD Defense in Spring or Summer 2020*
\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:timeline} presents a detailed plan for the completion of the remaining research proposed in this thesis document.

\section{Related Work}

My research is based on prior work that explores making recommendations to developers and technical approaches to increasing software engineering action adoption.

\subsection{Recommendations} 

\reword~Research has investigated how to make effective recommendations to users in many different domains. For software engineers, Murphy-Hill examined different ways developers learn about tools and found that \textit{peer interactions}, or learning about tools from peers during work activities, was the most effective~\cite{Murphy-Hill2011PeerInteraction}. Prior work has also proposed using concepts such as \textit{diffusion of innovations}~\cite{Diffusion}, \textit{idea gardening}~\cite{CaoIdeaGarden}, and \textit{information foraging theory}~\cite{FlemingInformationForaging} to spread ideas and make recommendations to software developers. To our knowledge, our work is the first research to integrate nudge theory into recommendations for software engineers. \details

\subsection{Adoption} 

\reword~Furthermore, prior work has proposed and evaluated methods to solve the software engineering adoption problem. Examples include using automated pull requests to encourage upgrading dependencies~\cite{SamUgrade}, screencasting to improve tool discovery~\cite{Murphy-HillScreencastingDiscovery}, crowdsourcing to enhance coding tutorials~\cite{gordon2015codepourri}, explorative and exploitative searching to recommend tasks to developers~\cite{karim2018learn}, logging to recommend Unix commands to users over a shared network~\cite{ToolBox}, creating a knowledge base to monitor developer action history to improve code navigation~\cite{Spyglass}, and gamification to improve experiences in development environments~\cite{barik2016game}. \details

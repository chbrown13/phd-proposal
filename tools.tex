\section{Tools}

This section outlines concepts for tools to develop and existing systems to observe for evaluating our approaches in making effective recommendations to software engineers.

\subsection{\TOOL}

% Prior work indicates \textit{active help systems} are more effective for providing suggestions to software users than passive help systems, which require users to deliberately seek help~\cite{FischerActiveHelp}.

% Research shows using software engineering tools can improve the quality of software and the efficiency of developers, but in reality developers rarely use them.



\subsection{\SUGGS}

GitHub recently introduced a new feature that allows developers to suggest a change to a project's code modified by a user.\footnote{https://help.github.com/articles/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request/\#applying-a-suggested-change} Suggestions can be utilized during pull request reviews, allowing reviewers to propose changes at the exact line of code in question and developers to easily accept or reject the change. Code reviews are another example of a software engineering action shown to improve code quality, and early feedback on the suggestion feature shows they are very popular and widely adopted by GitHub users. We plan to evaluate the effectiveness of GitHub suggestions as examples of a \location. These situated nudges already have over 100,000 uses on GitHub projects and developers are ``quick to adopt suggested changes" and integrate this feature into their code review process.\footnote{https://blog.github.com/2018-11-01-suggested-changes-update/} This research aims to examine situated nudges in the context of \SUGGS~to determine if the location of recommendations impacts the effectiveness of adoption for developers.

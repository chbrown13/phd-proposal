\begin{abstract}
Software engineering researchers create, develop, and evaluate a variety of tools and practices, or \textit{developer actions}, designed to help developers complete programming tasks. However, unfortunately software engineers often ignore these useful activities in practice. While automated recommender systems have been created to automatically increase awareness and encourage adoption of developer actions, research shows that face-to-face recommendations between colleagues is still the most effective mode of discovery for software engineers. To improve the effectiveness of automated tool recommendations, I propose integrating concepts from \textit{nudge theory}. Nudge theory is a behavioral science framework that examines how to influence human behavior and improve decision-making. This work seeks apply this theory to software engineering to discover the impact of nudges on improving developer behavior in the context of adopting tools and practices. The contributions of this thesis are: 1) \textit{a conceptual framework} explaining how to use concepts from nudge theory to identify the most effective strategy for making recommendations to software developers, 2) \textit{a set of experiments} that evaluate and provide evidence to support the conceptual framework, and 3) \textit{an automated recommender system}, called \TOOL, that utilizes the proposed framework to nudge software engineers to adopt useful development tools and activities. My research aims to demonstrate that incorporating concepts from nudge theory into automated recommendations to developers can increase adoption of developer actions among software engineers.
